# Equation-of-State
Lattice QCD based equations of state for 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to a hadron resonance gas from PDG16+

temp21.dat (2+1 EoS) and tempcharm.dat (2+1+1 EoS) contains the following:

  #of lines
  T [MeV] muB muS
  
derv21.dat (2+1 EoS) and dervcharm.dat (2+1+1 EoS) contains the following:

  #of lines
  energy [GeV/fm^3] pressure [GeV/fm^3]  entropy [1/fm^3]  dT/ds
  
The link to the corresponding resonance decays will be posted shortly.
